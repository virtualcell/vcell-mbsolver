# VCell Moving Boundary Solver

A C++ solver library for moving-boundary problems in biological systems.
A single build produces three artifacts:

| Artifact | Description |
|---|---|
| `MovingBoundarySolver` | Standalone command-line binary |
| `libMovingBoundaryLib` | Linkable static (or shared) library |
| `pyvcell_mbsolver` | Python package (pybind11 `_core` extension + wrapper) |

---

## Prerequisites

### All platforms

| Dependency | Notes |
|---|---|
| CMake ≥ 3.13 | <https://cmake.org/download/> |
| C++14 compiler | GCC 7+, Clang 6+, MSVC 2017+ |
| HDF5 (C + C++) | See platform sections below |
| Boost (headers) | `multi_array`, `iterator`, `logic`, `polygon` — header-only; see platform sections |
| Python 3 + headers | Python 3.8+ recommended |
| pybind11 | `pip install pybind11` or system package |

> Boost is **required** (header-only) — the build fails at configure time if it
> is not found. `libcurl` is only needed when `-DOPTION_TARGET_MESSAGING=ON`
> (off by default).

All former VCell monorepo dependencies (**FronTier**, **ExpressionParser**,
**vcommons**) are bundled in this repo and built automatically — no external
paths required.

## Building

### Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
# System dependencies
sudo apt-get install cmake libhdf5-dev libboost-dev python3-dev python3-pip pybind11-dev
pip3 install pybind11
# libcurl4-openssl-dev is only needed if you build with -DOPTION_TARGET_MESSAGING=ON

# Configure (substitute your actual library paths)
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build everything
cmake --build build --parallel
```

Output files land in `build/bin/`:

```
build/bin/
  MovingBoundarySolver              # binary
  libMovingBoundaryLib.a            # static library
  pyvcell_mbsolver/                 # Python package
    __init__.py                     #   high-level wrapper
    _core.cpython-*.so              #   compiled pybind11 extension
```

---

### macOS

```bash
# Dependencies via Homebrew
brew install cmake hdf5 boost python pybind11
# add `curl` too if you build with -DOPTION_TARGET_MESSAGING=ON

# Configure
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build everything
cmake --build build --parallel
```

For Apple Silicon the build system detects the architecture automatically and
sets `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64`. On Intel Macs it sets `x86_64`.

---

### Windows (Visual Studio + vcpkg)

Native Windows builds use MSVC (Visual Studio 2022 / Build Tools) with the C++
dependencies supplied by [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io). All source, tests, and the
Python extension build and pass on Windows.

Install prerequisites:
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or the Build Tools,
  with the **Desktop development with C++** workload (x64 toolset)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (check "Add to PATH")
- A bootstrapped [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) checkout (e.g. `C:\vcpkg`)
- [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/) — some vcpkg ports (curl/openssl)
  need it to build: `choco install strawberryperl`

The C++ dependencies (HDF5, Boost, curl, pybind11) are declared in `vcpkg.json`
and installed via vcpkg's manifest mode.

#### Easiest: the helper script

`build-windows.ps1` (repo root) reproduces the CI build end to end — it installs
the vcpkg dependencies, configures with the Visual Studio generator, and builds
Release:

```powershell
.\build-windows.ps1              # full build
.\build-windows.ps1 -Test        # build, then run ctest
.\build-windows.ps1 -SkipVcpkg   # skip the (slow) dependency install on reruns
```

#### Manual

```powershell
# 1. Install the manifest dependencies into .\vcpkg_installed
C:\vcpkg\vcpkg.exe install --triplet x64-windows

# 2. Configure. -G is required because a default of Ninja rejects -A x64;
#    the vcpkg toolchain makes CMake find the installed packages.
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 `
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake

# 3. Build
cmake --build build --config Release --parallel
```

Output files land in `build\bin\Release\` (binary + `.lib`), and the Python
package under `build\bin\pyvcell_mbsolver\`.

## Build options

| CMake variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` | `Release` | `Release`, `Debug`, `RelWithDebInfo`, `MinSizeRel` |
| `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` | `OFF` | Build `libMovingBoundaryLib` as a shared library instead of static |
| `BUILD_TESTING` | `ON` | Also build the `TestMovingBoundary` test executable |
| `VARIABLE_SPECIES_STORAGE` | `OFF` | Enable dynamic species storage (`-DMB_VARY_MASS`) |
| `OPTION_TARGET_MESSAGING` | `OFF` | Job-status messaging to VCell's broker via libcurl (on in the release builds) |
| `MB_BUILD_PYTHON` | `ON` | Build the pybind11 bindings; the release archives turn it off |
| `MB_HDF5_CONFIG` | `OFF` | Find HDF5 through its CMake package config (the release builds' static HDF5) |

Example — debug build, shared library, no tests:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
  -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF \
cmake --build build --parallel
```

---

## Running the tests

Tests are built by default (`BUILD_TESTING=ON`). After a successful build:

```bash
cd build
ctest --output-on-failure
```

### Test suites

All three suites run automatically when you invoke `ctest`. The Python tests
require `pytest` (`pip install pytest`).

| Suite | Name in ctest | Framework |
|---|---|---|
| Moving boundary unit tests (~150 cases) | `TestMovingBoundary.*` | Google Test |
| Expression parser smoke test | `ExpressionParserTest` | custom main |
| Python wrapper tests | `PyVcellMbSolver` | pytest |

### Python test prerequisites

No manual setup required. CMake creates an isolated virtual environment in
`build/python_venv/` at configure time and installs `pytest` into it
automatically. The venv is recreated on every `cmake -S . -B build` run.

The Python tests import `pyvcell_mbsolver._core` (the compiled extension) and
`pyvcell_mbsolver` (the high-level wrapper in `python/`). ctest sets
`PYTHONPATH` so the package is importable from the build tree without installation.

### Useful ctest options

```bash
# Run in parallel
ctest --output-on-failure -j$(nproc)

# Run only tests whose name matches a pattern
ctest --output-on-failure -R "algo"
ctest --output-on-failure -R "ExpressionParser"
ctest --output-on-failure -R "PyVcellMbSolver"

# List all registered tests without running them
ctest -N

# Show full output even for passing tests
ctest -V
```

### Running the Python tests directly

After configuring, the venv already has `pytest` installed. Run the suite
directly using the venv's Python:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=build/bin:python build/python_venv/bin/python -m pytest python/tests -v
```

On Windows, substitute `build\python_venv\Scripts\python.exe`.

### Skipping tests

Pass `-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF` at configure time to skip building and registering
the test executables entirely (this also disables the Python tests):

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
```

## Releases for VCell (SOLVER-RELEASE)

VCell consumes this repository through its GitHub releases and container
images, under the contract every VCell solver repository meets
([VCell `docs/plan-solver-repos.md` §1](https://github.com/virtualcell/vcell/blob/master/docs/plan-solver-repos.md)).
`.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml` implements it; a `vX.Y.Z` tag on `main`
(matching the `project()` version in `CMakeLists.txt`, which the workflow checks)
publishes everything below. Pull requests build and test all of it.

**Release assets** — each archive holds, at its root, the executable under the
name VCell resolves (`MovingBoundary_x64`, `.exe` on Windows), `LICENSE` and a
`VERSION` file; no static libraries or test binaries.

| asset | built on | contents |
|---|---|---|
| `linux64.tgz` | `manylinux_2_28_x86_64` | runs on glibc ≥ 2.28. HDF5 1.14 and an HTTP-only libcurl are linked **statically**; it needs only glibc, `libstdc++` and `libgcc_s` (checked by `packaging/check-portable.sh`) |
| `linux64arm.tgz` | `manylinux_2_28_aarch64` | the same for aarch64 |
| `mac64.tgz` | `macos-15` + `macos-15-intel` | a **universal** (arm64 + x86_64) binary, macOS ≥ 11, HDF5 static, only `/usr/lib` system libraries (libc++, libcurl), ad-hoc signed |
| `win64.zip` | `windows-latest` (MSVC, vcpkg) | the exe with its HDF5/zlib DLLs and the MSVC runtime DLLs next to it (`packaging/bundle-windows.py`) |
| `SHA256SUMS` | | a checksum for each archive |

Messaging (`-tid <n>` plus the `<jms>` block VCell writes for HPC runs, reported
to the broker's REST API) is compiled into the Linux and macOS builds; the
Windows build leaves it out, since the desktop client never passes `-tid`.

**Container image** `ghcr.io/virtualcell/vcell-mbsolver:<X.Y.Z>` (and `:latest`),
linux/amd64 + linux/arm64: `debian:bookworm-slim` plus the Linux archive's
contents in `/opt/vcell/bin` (on `PATH`) — `docker/Dockerfile` compiles nothing.
**SIF** `oras://ghcr.io/virtualcell/vcell-mbsolver_singularity:<X.Y.Z>` (amd64),
built from that image and pushed with ORAS.

**Entry point** `/usr/local/bin/vcell-solver-entrypoint` (`docker/entrypoint.sh`):
no argument or `--help` prints the version and the executables and exits 0; a
first argument naming a provided executable is `exec`ed (exit codes and SIGTERM
pass through); anything else prints usage and exits 2. It writes nothing, runs
as any uid and works from a read-only SIF, with argv as VCell's SlurmProxy writes it:

```bash
singularity run --containall --bind /share/apps/vcell3/users:/simdata <sif> \
    MovingBoundary_x64 --config /simdata/<user>/SimID_<key>_0_mb.xml -tid 0
```

**Smoke test and reference.** `smoke/` holds a VCell-generated input
(`SimID_254696951_0_mb.xml`: the *MBswept* model — a circular cell translating
with velocity (sin t, cos t), two diffusing species, 31×31 nodes, t ∈ [0, 1]) and
`reference.h5`, its output from the legacy `MovingBoundary_x64` (vcell-solvers
v0.0.44-dev4, macOS x86_64), which is bit-identical to the
`ghcr.io/virtualcell/vcell-solvers:v0.8.2` image's. CI runs it through every
archive, the image (as a non-root uid with a read-only root) and the SIF (under
`apptainer run --containall`), each with `-tid 0`, compares every species at
every output time with `smoke/compare.py`, and checks that a run with a `<jms>`
block reports its worker events to a stand-in broker (`smoke/fake_broker.py`).

To run it by hand:

```bash
python smoke/prepare.py /tmp/mb --output-dir /tmp/mb
MovingBoundary_x64 --config /tmp/mb/SimID_254696951_0_mb.xml
python smoke/compare.py smoke/reference.h5 /tmp/mb/SimID_254696951_0_.h5
```

**Cutting a release.** Bump `project(VCellMovingBoundary VERSION X.Y.Z)` in
`CMakeLists.txt` (the Python wheel version follows it), merge to `main`, then tag
`vX.Y.Z` on `main`. The tag also triggers `wheels.yml`, which publishes
`pyvcell_mbsolver` X.Y.Z to PyPI.

---

## Using the binary

```bash
./build/bin/MovingBoundarySolver --config <input_mb.xml> [-tid <n>]
```

The input file format is described in `metadata/MovingBoundarySolverInputFile.docx`
and validated by `Solver/MovingBoundarySetup.xsd`.

---

## Linking the library

Add to your project's `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
find_library(MB_LIB MovingBoundaryLib HINTS /path/to/vcell-mbsolver/build/bin)
find_path(MB_INCLUDE MovingBoundaryParabolicProblem.h
    HINTS /path/to/vcell-mbsolver/Solver/include)

target_link_libraries(my_target PRIVATE ${MB_LIB})
target_include_directories(my_target PRIVATE ${MB_INCLUDE})
```

Or install the project first and use the installed headers under
`<prefix>/include/vcell-mbsolver/`.

---

## Using the Python module

The bindings are shipped as the **`pyvcell_mbsolver`** package: the compiled
extension is the private submodule `pyvcell_mbsolver._core`, and the high-level
wrapper (`MovingBoundarySolver`, observer base classes) is the package itself.

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "/path/to/vcell-mbsolver/build/bin")

import pyvcell_mbsolver
from pyvcell_mbsolver import MovingBoundarySolver   # high-level wrapper
from pyvcell_mbsolver import _core                  # low-level C++ API
# See python/pyvcellmbsolver.cpp for the exposed _core API
```

After `cmake --install build --prefix /usr/local`, the package is installed to
the active Python's `site-packages` and importable directly:

```python
import pyvcell_mbsolver
```

---

## Python package & wheels

The repository also ships a [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) build
configuration (`pyproject.toml`, using the
[`scikit-build-core`](https://scikit-build-core.readthedocs.io/) backend) that
drives the same CMake build to produce an installable Python wheel. The wheel
contains only the `pyvcell_mbsolver` package (the `_core` extension and its
pure-Python wrapper) — not the C++ library, CLI binary, or headers.

### Install from a downloaded wheel

CI builds redistributable wheels for **Linux** (x86_64 + arm64) and **macOS**
(x86_64 + arm64, macOS 15+) and uploads them as workflow artifacts (see the
**Wheels** GitHub Actions workflow). Download the wheel for your
platform/Python version and:

```bash
pip install pyvcell_mbsolver-<version>-<tags>.whl
python -c "import pyvcell_mbsolver; from pyvcell_mbsolver import _core; print('ok')"
```

The wheels are self-contained: the shared HDF5 libraries are vendored in by the
wheel-repair step (`auditwheel` / `delocate`), so no system HDF5 install is
required to *use* a wheel.

> Native Windows source builds are supported via the Visual Studio/vcpkg flow
> above, but redistributable Windows wheels are not published yet. Use the
> source-build steps from the Windows section when building on MSVC.

### Build a wheel locally

Building from source still needs the native toolchain and dependencies from the
[Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section (CMake, a C++14 compiler, HDF5, Boost):

```bash
pip install build
python -m build --wheel          # writes dist/pyvcell_mbsolver-*.whl
pip install dist/pyvcell_mbsolver-*.whl
```

`pip install .` works too. Wheel builds set `BUILD_TESTING=OFF` and
`OPTION_TARGET_MESSAGING=OFF` automatically (see `[tool.scikit-build]` in
`pyproject.toml`).

### Publishing to PyPI

The **Wheels** workflow has a `publish` job that uploads the built wheels and
sdist to PyPI via [trusted publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/)
(OIDC — no stored API token). It runs **only on `v*` tag pushes** and stays
dormant until a one-time setup is done on PyPI:

1. Register the project on PyPI (claim the `pyvcell_mbsolver` name).
2. Under the project's *Publishing* settings, add a **trusted publisher**:
   - Owner: `virtualcell`, Repository: `vcell-mbsolver`
   - Workflow: `wheels.yml`, Environment: `pypi`
3. Create the `pypi` environment in the repo settings (optionally with
   reviewers/branch protection).

Once configured, pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag builds all wheels and publishes them.
Until then, normal pushes and PRs simply produce downloadable wheel artifacts.

#### Dry run on TestPyPI first (recommended)

The workflow also has a `publish-testpypi` job to rehearse the release against
[TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org) before touching real PyPI. It runs only when
the workflow is **manually dispatched** with the `testpypi` flag, and needs its
own one-time setup mirroring the above:

1. Create a [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org) account (separate from PyPI; 2FA
   required).
2. At <https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/>, add a **pending
   publisher**:
   - PyPI Project Name: `pyvcell_mbsolver`
   - Owner: `virtualcell`, Repository: `vcell-mbsolver`
   - Workflow: `wheels.yml`, Environment: `testpypi`
3. Create a `testpypi` environment in the repo settings.

Then trigger the dry run (no tag needed):

```bash
gh workflow run wheels.yml -f testpypi=true
```

(or **Actions → Wheels → Run workflow**, check the box). It builds all wheels +
sdist and uploads them to TestPyPI; `skip-existing` keeps repeat runs of the
same version from failing. Verify at
<https://test.pypi.org/project/pyvcell-mbsolver/>, then do the real release by
tagging `vX.Y.Z`.
